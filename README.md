# Angular Code Review Exercise

Welcome! This is a collaborative exercise to help us understand your approach to analyzing and improving code. There are no right or wrong answers, only talking points.
# The Scenario

You've been asked to review a legacy `UserListComponent` before adding a new feature. The component:

- Fetches a list of users from an API.
- Displays the user list.
- Allows an admin to "promote" a user.

The code works, but it was written quickly and has several areas for improvement.
# Your Task

Your goal is to review the code in `user-list.component.ts`, `user-list.component.html`, and `user-list.component.css` and discuss your findings with us.

We are interested in your thoughts on topics like:

- **Best Practices & Code Quality**
- **Maintainability & Testability**
- **Performance Bottlenecks**
- **Potential Bugs & Memory Leaks**
- **The "Why"** behind your suggestions

We look forward to our discussion
